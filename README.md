# HTTP Routing - lab 9

**Author**: [Cari Palazzolo](https://github.com/caripizza)

## Overview
In this lab, I implemented a simple object database that stores and retrieves JSON objects from the file system (people, puppies, and cats); includes full CRUD for all routes and app-wide unit test coverage. The app also utilizes The Star Wars API for selecting favorite Star Wars characters when creating and updating people.
